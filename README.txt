Here are the instructions to run the Python file:

1. Open the complete folder in Visual Studio Code or any other text editor that supports Python.
2. Make sure you delete the following folders/files if they exists:
    - StoredDataFiles
    - Output Data Structures.xlsx
    - Output_Data.txt
3. Make sure there is Input.xl file in resources and Run the file "article_text_detection_and_analysis.py".
4. This Python program generates a folder named "StoredDataFiles" and stores all the data of the articles data with the name of URL_ID.txt.
5. After that, an Excel file named "Output Data Structures.xlsx" is generated with all the output variables data.
6. Lastly, "Output_Data.txt" is generated with all the variable results.
